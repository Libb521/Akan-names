                    <p>Akan names are derived from people of Ghana. They frequently name their children after the day of the week they were born
                        and the order in which they were born. These "day names" have further meanings concerning the
                        soul and character of the person. Middle names have considerably more variety and can refer to
                        their birth order, twin status, or an ancestor's middle name. <br>
